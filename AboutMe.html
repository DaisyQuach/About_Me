       <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Daisy Quach, and I am currently 16 years old. I was born and raised in Utah, and I have lived here for all of my life. At the moment, I am attending Itineris Early College High School in hopes of getting my associate’s degree by the time I graduate. To be honest, everyone in my life has viewed me as a huge nerd who always gets straight A’s. Although that may be true to some extent, I strongly believed that I am the way today because of my hard work and efforts. 
                Aside from academics, I have a strong passion for leadership and service. I often find myself trying to take lead and participate in any roles in my community. For example, I have previously been a part of the Peer Leadership team at Hawthorn Academy. My school, currently, does not have a student government system, but we do have amazing clubs. Right now, I’m am a part of the National Honors Society (NHS). Here, we practice the four pillars: scholarship, character, service, and leadership. Another club I am taking at the moment is Health Occupation Students of America (HOSA), where we learn a ton about the medical world. These two clubs are very personal to me, and I honestly feel like I am a part of a huge family. 
                Of course, I have other hobbies as well. I absolutely LOVE crafting and drawing, and I have made gifts and even sold my creations. I particularly have no interest of getting into an art school, but my creative tendencies have given me the desire to get into the engineering world. However, like many students at my age, I’m not a hundred percent sure of what I want to do with my life. Perhaps I might go into architectural engineering because of my strange love of mathematics, or I might go into biomedical engineering because of my fascination of the human genome. Whatever it is, I’m glad to have you be a part of the journey I’ve just begun.
